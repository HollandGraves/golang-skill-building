package main

/*
- Create a new type: vehicle with underlying type is a struct
- The fields: doors, color
- Create two new types: truck & sedan with both underlying types as struct
- Embed the “vehicle” type in both truck & sedan
- Give truck the field “fourWheel” which will be set to bool
- Give sedan the field “luxury” which will be set to bool.
- Using the vehicle, truck, and sedan structs: using a composite literal create a value of type truck and assign values to the fields
- using a composite literal, create a value of type sedan and assign values to the fields
- Print out each of these values
- Print out a single field from each of these values
- Give a method to both the “truck” and “sedan” types with the following signature transportationDevice() string
- Have each func return a string saying what they do
- Create a value of type truck and populate the fields
- Create a value of type sedan and populate the fields
- Call the method for each value.
- Create a new type called “transportation” with underlying type interface.
- Create a func called “report” that takes a value of type “transportation” as an argument
- The func should print the string returned by “transportationDevice()” being called for any type that implements the “transportation” interface
- Call “report” passing in a value of type truck
- Call “report” passing in a value of type sedan.
